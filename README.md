My wife and I are gamers, both video and tabletop, so I created a quick little portal page to organize our [boardgamegeek](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/) data.

If you'd like to use this script, the primary thing to change is line **3** of **index.php** to your BGG username.

Otherwise, good luck, have fun, and if you have any ideas on improving it please feel free to file an [issue](https://github.com/peoii/gamesca/issues)
